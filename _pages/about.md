I'm a young IT enthusiast & web developer from Switzerland who is truly interested in web development and other IT stuff. In my spare time, I like to code and strengthen my skills. Furthermore, I'm in a brass band, a scout leader, and a snowboarder in winter.

With this blog, I want to share my knowledge and experiences. I write about things that I have learned or found helpful. Besides, there will be some tutorials and general tips and tricks for non-IT people, which I find profitable for others to know.

You are welcome to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
