I'm a 3rd year IT student from Switzerland. I am learning IT, and I am much interested in Web development. In my free time, I like to code and learn new languages or improve them. I also make music in a brass band and in winter, I like to go snowboarding.

On this website, I will post some of my projects and some tutorials. I hope you will enjoy it!
