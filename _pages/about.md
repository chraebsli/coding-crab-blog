I'm a 3rd year IT student from Switzerland. I am learning IT, and I am much interested in Web development. In my free time, I like to code and learn new languages, or improve them. I also make music in a brass band and in winter, I go snowboarding.

With this website, I want to share my knowledge and my experiences with you, as a new coder. I write about things that I have learned. Also, there will be some tutorials and general tips and tricks for non-IT people, which I find useful for others to know.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.
