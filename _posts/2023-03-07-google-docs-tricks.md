## Convert Microsoft Word to Google Docs

You are able to convert Microsoft Word documents to Google Docs. Although you can edit word documents in Google Docs and also collaborate with others, you might ask why you should convert it. The reason is, that there is a possibility when you are using some Google Docs features and edit the document in Microsoft Word, the document will be corrupted. And when you convert it to Google Docs, you can use all the features of Google Docs, including extensions and you are only able to edit it in Google Docs.

**How to convert it:**

1. Open the document in Google Docs
2. Navigate to _File_ > _Save as Google Docs_
3. The Google Docs version will be opened in a new tab and is saved at the same location
4. Check if the document is working as expected
5. Delete the original document

**Note:** This also works with Excel and PowerPoint documents. (`docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx`)
