# Coding Crab Blog

## About

I'm an IT student and with this website, I want to share my knowledge and my experiences with you, as a new coder. I write about things that I have learned. Also, there will be some tutorials and general tips and tricks for non-IT people, which I find useful for others to know.

## Setup

1. Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the server.
3. Open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser.
