# Coding Crab Blog

## About

I'm a young IT enthusiast & web developer from Switzerland. With this blog, I want to share my knowledge and experiences. I write about things that I have learned or found helpful. Besides, there will be some tutorials and general tips and tricks for non-IT people, which I find profitable for others to know.
